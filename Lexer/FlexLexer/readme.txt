You can compile the flex lexer with writing "make" command to terminal.

After makefile, If you want to start the lexer with a file, write to the terminal "./g++ input.txt"
With this command, lexer will take the "input.txt" as input and prints the tokens to terminal.

After makefile, If you want to start REPL, write to the terminal "./g++"
With this command, it will take the input from terminal and prints the result to terminal.
You can finish the REPL with writing "finish" to terminal as a input.
