If you want to start the lisp gpp lexer with a file, write to the terminal "clisp gpp_lexer.lisp input.txt"
With this command, lexer will take the "input.txt" as input and prints the tokens to terminal.

If you want to start REPL, write to the terminal "clisp gpp_lexer.lisp"
With this command, it will take the input from terminal and prints the result to terminal.
You can finish the REPL with writing "finish" to terminal as a input.
